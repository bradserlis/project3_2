# What is it?
TellEm is an anonymous community-centric forum for asking questions about the relationships in your life - romantic or platonic, roomates, co-workers, bosses, bandmates, teammates, etc. 


# Proposal
 Create an app that encourages opinion-sharing towards navigating relationship questions. When a friend isn't sitting in the room to hear you out and offer their advice, turn to your community on the app for support.

 Some of the stretch goals included the ability to receive push notifications when a user's post received a comment, and gamifying participation (through 'level-ups' by posting  questions and leaving comments that are well-received).

# Technology
React Native (Native Base, React Navigation), FireBase, JavaScript 


# Approach Taken
Most importantly, I wanted anonymity, so that you could ask whichever questions you had on your mind. Your responses, too, needed to be anonymous, so that you felt encouraged to contribute right away. I  used react-native to create a truly mobile-centered app so that it had the opportunity for easy app store integration in the future.


# Unsolved
Gamification is not yet implemented. Looking to add to the profile page a user's posts while still maintaining an anonymity.
