# What is it?
TellEm is an anonymous community-centric forum for asking questions about the relationships in your life - romantic or platonic, roomates, co-workers, bosses, bandmates, teammates, etc. 


# Proposal
Most importantly, I wanted anonymity, so that you could ask whichever questions you had on your mind. Your responses, too, needed to be anonymous, so that you felt encouraged to contribute right away.

I wanted to use react-native to create a truly mobile-centered app. Some of the stretch goals included the ability to receive push notifications when a user's post received a comment, and gamifying participation (through 'level-ups' by posting  questions and leaving comments that are well-received).


# Technology
React-Native (Native Base, React Navigation), FireBase, JavaScript 


# Approach Taken



# Unsolved
Gamification is not yet implemented. Looking to add to the profile page a user's posts while still maintaining an anonymity.
